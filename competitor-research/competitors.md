### Target user (ICP)
Developers at startups and small teams that are looking for quick deployment of apps with minimum management of the infrastructure.

### Positioning
“Modern apps. Instantly delivered.”

### Where they overlap with Clode
- Assimilation of deployment process
- DevOps for taking hire less.

### How Clode is different
- Little abstraction and lock-in with Clode
- Total automation and not hiding of cloud infrastructure is the goal of Clode

### DevRel angle
A majority of the PaaS tools settle for lack of long-term control in exchange for the speed of short-term. Clode gives an insight into how the teams can get the cloud setup done fast without any loss of ownership.
