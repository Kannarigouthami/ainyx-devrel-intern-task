## Developer FAQs & Objections

## Q1: Can Clode simply be categorized under PaaS?

No. Clode automates infrastructure and operations without completely abstracting away cloud details.

## Q2: Will Clode tie me to a particular cloud vendor?

No. Clode is intended for use within a cloud system that already exists. It prevents vendor lock-in.

## Q3: In what ways is Clode distinct from Terraform, et al.?

Terraform is geared towards provisioning. Clode is concerned with the automation of deployment and other operations following provisioning.

## Q4: Does Clode replace CI/CD tools?

No. This completes the CI/CD process by dealing with events that occur after code deployment.

## Q5: Who is Clode best suited for?

Startups or lean engineering teams that aim to minimize the cost of DevOps without sacrificing control.
## Q6: Does Clode only cater to early-stage startups?
In many No. It’s meant for supporting teams from the early phase through scaling without re-architecting. # Q7: What setup effort does Clode involve? Compared to the integration of multiple DevOps and infrastructure technologies via stitching. Q8: In what way does it differ from managed platforms? Managed platforms are platforms that optimize for simplicity but constrain flexibility. Clode maintains flexibility and automates processes. ## Q9: Does Clode include observability? Clode is positioned right next to observability and concentrates on automating day-to-day workflows that are guided by signals. ## Q10: Why can't everything just be built to exist solely on the cloud? Direct cloud configurations provide flexibility but involve a lot of operational overhead, of which Clode mitigates.
