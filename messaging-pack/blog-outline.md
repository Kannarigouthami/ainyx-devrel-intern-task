## Title
Why Startups Struggle to Balance Speed and Control in the Cloud

## Introduction
- Modern startups are expected to ship fast with small teams
- Cloud infrastructure has become more powerful—but also more complex
- Most teams feel pressure to choose between speed and long-term control

## The Promise of Managed Platforms
- Easy onboarding and fast deployments
- Minimal infrastructure setup
- Great experience for early-stage teams

## Where Managed Platforms Fall Short
- Limited customization as products grow
- Rising costs at scale
- Vendor lock-in and constrained architectures

## The Other Extreme: Raw Cloud Infrastructure
- Full flexibility and control
- High operational overhead
- Requires deep DevOps expertise and ongoing maintenance

## Patterns Observed Across DevOps Tools
- Many tools solve narrow problems well
- Teams stitch together CI/CD, infra, monitoring, and scripts
- Operational complexity increases over time

## How Clode Approaches the Problem Differently
- Focus on automating deploy → operate → monitor stages
- Reduce repetitive manual work instead of hiding infrastructure
- Designed to grow with teams, not block them later

## Conclusion
- Speed and control shouldn’t be a trade-off
- Cloud automation should be a force multiplier, not a burden
- Rethinking DevOps tooling for modern startup realities
