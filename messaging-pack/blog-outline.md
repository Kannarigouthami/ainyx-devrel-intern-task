# Introduction
- New age startups have to deliver products quickly with leaner teams

- Today, cloud infrastructure is more powerful, yet more complicated
- Most teams are faced with the dilemma of whether to pursue speed or control.
# The Promise of Managed Platforms
The next generation of computing

User-friendly onboarding process and Quick deployment
- Infrastructure setup needs are minimal
• Helpful for early teams

## Where Managed Platforms Fall Short
- Restricted Customization With Growing Products
- Scalable cost of living increases

Vendor lock-in and Architects Constraints
The Other Extreme: Raw Cloud Infrastructure
- Complete flexibility and freedom

- High operational overhead costs.
- Involves high expertise in DevOps tools and maintenance
# Patterns Identified Across DevOps Tools
Patterns were identified across

- There are many tools that excel at solving a specific problem
- Teams integrate CI/CD, infra, monitoring, and scripts
– The operation complexity rises with time
# How Clode Approaches the Problem Differently
In fact - Automate “deploy → operate → monitor” process - Minimize repetitive work by hand instead of hiding the infrastructure - This technology is capable of scaling with organizations rather than hindering them down the road. ## Conclusion – Speed and control should not compromise each other - Cloud Automation Should Be a Force Multiplier, Not a Burden - Redefining DevOps tools in light of new realities faced by startups
