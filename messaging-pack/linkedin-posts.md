## Post 1: The Speed vs Control Trap in DevOps

Contempo start - ups need to deliver fast from around day one.

But the reality is that the infrastructure needed to “deploy, run, and grow” software has continued to grow in complexity.

In my investigation of cloud platforms and DevOps software, I see that a particular trend emerges repeatedly:

“Teams opt for fully managed platforms, which are optimized for speed, and sometimes they choose to build on cloud providers to maintain control. But they don’t usually do both.”

These platforms allow easy onboarding, but as the product matures, teams begin running out of capabilities related to customization and cost or scalability. On the other side, the naked cloud configuration provides scalability but results in high operational burden chosen by small teams.

It’s a trade-off that many developer tools are quietly forcing upon teams.
Most developer tools are built to support Windows,

Clode helps resolve this tension. Instead of hiding infrastructure behind rigid abstractions, it concentrates on automating repetitive work that slows teams down at the levels of deploy, operate, and monitor.

This gives you faster shipping *without* sacrificing your ownership rights within your cloud platform.

This translates to more time for product development and fewer hours on infrastructure for the developer community.

## Post 2: CI/CD Isn't the Hard Part—Operations Are

The state of CI/CD technology has changed for the better over the last several years.

Starting pipelines, running tests, and deploying code is no longer the most difficult part.

What happens *after* deployment is.

Looking through various DevOps and platform tools, I see one thing: the majority of the tools only go as far as the delivery aspect. This is when the integration of scripts, dashboards, alerts, and manual procedures kicks in.

This makes the operation more complex, thereby slowly devouring engineering speed.

Clode tackles this issue in a different way by concentrating on the later phases of the SDLC process — Deploy, Operate, and Monitor – as a single workflow process. Rather than introducing further tools into DevOps, it focuses on minimizing manual effort for keeping applications in a healthful state in production. For lean teams and start-ups, this is important. It is the difference between firefighting infrastructure problems all the time and infrastructure that basically takes care of itself. Developer productiveness is more than just getting code out the door quickly – it has to do with lessening the operational burden that follows.
