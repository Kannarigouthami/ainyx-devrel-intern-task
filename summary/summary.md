# Final Summary

## Most Crowded Categories
- Cloud infrastructure automation
– Developer and DevOps Tooling

- Platform engineering and PaaS solutions
## Important Findings Identified Among Rivals
1. Many tools choose simplicity early on, once teams get bigger, they become very limited.

2. Tooling can be disjointed, causing teams to have to use multiple, unconnected systems.
3. Complexity escalates operationally beyond the ability of the engineering team to address.
## Recommended Positioning Angles for Clode
1. Automation without losing any cloud ownership or flexibility. 2. Designed for startups that want to move quickly today without re-platforming tomorrow. 3. Lessening DevOps overhead through automation of tasks, not just deployment/provisioning activities.
